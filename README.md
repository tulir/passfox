# passFox
A passwordstore.org extension for Firefox.

You can find signed packages in the [Release section](https://github.com/tulir/passfox/releases)

## Features
passFox is at a very early stage, but the basic features work.

### Currently implemented features
* Listing passwords and directories
* Basic search (case-insensitive, by file and directory name)
* Copying passwords, usernames and one-time passwords*
* Displaying the content of password files
* Creating, editing and deleting passwords

\* OTP currently only with [my pass fork (tulir/pass)](https://github.com/tulir/pass).
I haven't been able to find a nice JavaScript OTP library.

### Planned features
* Autofill?
